Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the the systematic application of principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of the modern man, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages (e.g. Fortran, C).
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes the following:
Req

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
